- I chose a blue color scheme for this gym website as requested by the Gym as it matches the company logo and the general theme inside the actual gym. I also beleives it conveys a sense of trust, reliability, and calmness. Blue is often associated with stability and dependability, which are important qualities for a gym to convey to potential customers. Using different shades of blue adds depth and variety to the color palette, while still maintaining a cohesive look. The light background, mostly white, creates a clean and airy feel that is both visually appealing and easy to read. Overall, this color scheme helps create a sense of professionalism and competence, which can encourage potential customers to trust the gym and take action towards their fitness goals.
